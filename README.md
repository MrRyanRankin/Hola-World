# Hola-World

My first repository!

I'm an aspiring full-stack developer, and I've been teaching myself front-end development skills for about one year. I'm currently comfortable with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Jquery.

I live in sunny Orlando, Florida, and I love nothing more than to sit outsie by the pool and write code!
